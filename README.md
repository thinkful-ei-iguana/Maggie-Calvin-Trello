# Maggie-Calvin-Trello

You're required to create a new "create-react-app" project called trelloyes. Remove the boilerplate so you have a clean start and then focus on building 3 components: App, List, and Card.

Card.js:

The Card component should render markup matching the design.html: a div with a class of 'Card' containing an h3 for the card's title and a p element for the card's content.
The Card component accepts 2 props: title and content.
title is a string of the card's title.
content is a string of the card's content.
These props will be passed in for each Card from the List component.
List.js:

The List component should render markup matching the design.html: a section with a class of 'List', containing a header and div with class 'List-cards'.
The List component accepts 2 props: header and cards.
header is a string of the header of the card to render.
cards is an array of card objects. Each object should have a title and content.
These props will be passed in for each List from the App component.
The List should render a Card component for each of the cards in the cards array prop.
Each instance of the Card component should be passed 2 props (and a key). The 2 props are title and content.
The title prop is a string for the Card's title.
The content prop is a string of the Card's content.
App.js:

The App component should render markup matching the design.html: the main element, a header with the h1 and a div with class 'App-list'.
The App component will accept 1 prop, store.
The store prop is an object with 2 keys: lists and allCards.
lists is an array of objects.
allCards is an object where each key is a card's ID and the value is the card object with a title and content.
You'll be given a dummy STORE object to pass to your App.
The App should render a List component for each of the items in the store.lists array.
Each instance of the List component should be passed 2 props (and a key). The 2 props are header and cards.
The header prop is a string for the List's header.
The cards prop will be an array of card objects.
You'll need to combine the cardIds array for the list with the allCards object.
